This is a project for pedagogical purposes. During the pandemic, we all had to experience online classes; even after that, some have inclined a bit towards online learning.
In this project, I first scrape tweets from tweeter with relevant keywords to online learning. 
I do a descriptive data summary and then label them using a Python library. And finally, I perform a classification model on these data.
